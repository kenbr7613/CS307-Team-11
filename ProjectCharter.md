Problem Statement
    Every semester students at Purdue and universities across the country are faced with the task of registering for multiple courses to meet their degree requirements. This is often done with a simple text based interface that limits the users ability to see scheduling conflicts and alternative class times. By developing a web-based graphical interface with a MySQL and Perl back end, we can create an easy way for students to schedule their classes and track their progress towards graduation.

Product Objectives
    Our system will provide the following features:
An intuitive graphical user interface that assists users in searching for and scheduling classes more easily;
An advanced class search feature that accepts various search parameters and provides all classes that meet the criteria;
A tool that allows students who are enrolled in the same section of the class to conveniently communicate with each other;
A tool that enables students to organize required courses to graduate on time;
An interface that provides a more in-depth look at the course, supplying information such as the email of the instructor, the prerequisites for the course, etc. 
A “friends” features that allows you to view, with their permission, other students’ class times in order to match schedules. 

Stakeholders
The main users for our project are the students of Purdue University. ITaP will also benefit from the service. 

Project Deliverables
    A web service that will aid Purdue students in creating a tailored class schedule much more easily than with the tools currently available. The system will provide a course scheduling tool using Purdue’s course information and the user’s graduation requirements, time preferences, and other personal options. The service will be accessed through an internet browser that connects to a web server hosting the service. This server will retrieve information from a database storing Purdue class catalogue data, process the information with a variety of scripts, and send the parsed data back to the client’s web browser.

I just wrote a few things in my mind in “Project Deliverables”. Please feel free to add more contents to the section.  --- Qiming

Moved Qiming’s project deliverables to product objective. Added team members and project deliverables. --Kihyun

Added some objectives, and stakeholders. --Nick

I added some things to objectives and deliverables and polished the whole thing up a bit. At around 8:00 PM on Friday I plan on turning the charter in to blackboard, so feel free to make changes before then and let me know if you need more time and/or want to turn it in yourself. - Ben

Just submitted it. -Ben
